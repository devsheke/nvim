# nvim
A really simple Neovim config that helps me get work done.

## Plugins
Here's an overview of some notable plugins I use:

- [**Lualine**](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) - Simple yet informative status line.
- [**Neorg**](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) - For note taking and some journaling on the side.
- [**Trouble**](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim) - Helps me look at file level and project level diagnostic info.
- [**Telescope**](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) - Switching between buffers and for project level file search.

## Theme
Been using Ros√© Pine since day one. Switched to light theme recently.
